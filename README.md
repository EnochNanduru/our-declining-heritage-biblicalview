## Purpose & Scope  
This project weaves together demographic research and biblical theology:

* **Data-driven insight** – Charts track TFR trends from 1960 to 2023 at global, national, and Indian state levels.  
* **Policy sandbox** – A drop-down “AI Insights” panel (coming soon) will outline possible economic, social, and spiritual implications of low fertility, generated with LLM-based analysis.  
* **Biblical commentary** – Key passages (e.g., Genesis 1 : 27–28, Psalm 127 : 3–5) are presented in English KJV, Marathi *Pavitra Shastra*, and Telugu, accompanied by concise Greek keyword notes and John MacArthur references to ground the conversation in sound doctrine.
